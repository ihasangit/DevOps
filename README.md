## üñ•Ô∏è GitHub

GitHub is an online platform that allows developers to host, share, and collaborate on code repositories using Git, a version control system. It acts as a central place where teams and individuals can manage their code, track changes, and work together effectively.

### Key Features of GitHub
#### Repositories:
A repository (or "repo") is a project folder that contains your code, files, and history of changes.
- Public repositories can be viewed by anyone, while private ones are accessible only to specific users.

#### Branches:
Branches allow you to create separate versions of your project for development or experimentation without affecting the main code.

#### Pull Requests (PRs):
Pull requests are proposals to merge changes from one branch into another. They enable team members to review and discuss changes before integration.

#### Version Control:
GitHub uses Git to track changes to your files over time, making it easy to revert to earlier versions or see who made specific changes.

#### Collaboration Tools:
Comment on code, review changes, and discuss issues directly within the platform.

#### GitHub Pages:
Host static websites directly from your repository.

#### Actions:
Automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying your applications.

### Why Use GitHub?
- **Version Control**: Tracks every change in your project, ensuring nothing is lost.
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously.
- **Backup**: Stores your code securely in the cloud.
- **Open Source**: Supports open-source projects, allowing developers worldwide to contribute.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with tools like Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes for CI/CD pipelines.
